Game Title: A Kitsune's Tale
Game Description: Written in C# on top of the Unity engine, A Kitsune's Tale is an educational 2D-platformer with RPG combat in which you control a kitsune - a half human, half fox youkai (Japanese spirit) - in the care of the Goddess Inari. To attack enemies in combat, you must draw kanji corresponding to the type of attack/magic you want to use, thus learning through time some of the kanji presented in the game. You will also have to talk to villagers who only know Japanese, thus you will learn certain grammatical structures and often-used sentences, alongside vocabulary. The game's bread and butter is its handwriting OCR (optical character recognition) software which utilizes the Tesseract API.

Why Unity?
It allows for ease of portability between compiling for Android and Windows. I'm also already accustomed to the Unity engine, so that was a hurdle I have already jumped.

Why Tesseract?
I tried to write several wrappers for different APIs, but Tesseract played the nicest, on top of being free to use.

How to run?
Just run the .exe file provided in "../A Kitsune's Tale" (from current directory) (should be named "A Kitsune's Tale.exe").

How to use?
Run the executable, hit New Game and, most importantly, enjoy!
